# Autoencoder Demos: Denoising & PCA Comparison

This repository hosts two Autoencoder-based projects focused on noise reduction and dimensionality reduction.
These demos showcase how autoencoders can be applied to clean noisy data and how they compare to traditional
methods like PCA. More projects will be added in the near future.

## Sub-Repositories

### 1. [autoencoder-noise-removal]
- **Description:** Demonstrates how an autoencoder can effectively remove noise from images.
- **Features:**
  - Trains on clean and noisy image pairs
  - Learns to reconstruct clean images from noisy inputs
- **Goal:** Show how autoencoders can denoise data by learning compressed representations.

### 2. [autoencoder-vs-pca]
- **Description:** Compares an autoencoder to PCA for dimensionality reduction and reconstruction.
- **Features:**
  - Side-by-side reconstruction results
  - Quantitative comparison (e.g. MSE)
- **Goal:** Visualize and evaluate the strengths and limits of PCA vs autoencoders.
